# AIO Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have either developed independently or collaborated on as part of the AIO curriculum. Each project addresses specific requirements or challenges set by the AIO program, showcasing a range of skills and technologies.

Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

- **[Project 1.2]**: Chatbot with RAG system.
- **[Project 2.2]**: Email Classification system.

Feel free to explore each project folder for detailed documentation, source code, and instructions on how to run or use the projects.
