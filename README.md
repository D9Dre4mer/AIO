# AIO Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have either developed independently or collaborated on as part of the AIO curriculum. Each project addresses specific requirements or challenges set by the AIO program, showcasing a range of skills and technologies.

Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

- **[Project Name 1]**: Short description of the project, its purpose, and technologies used.
- **[Project Name 2]**: Short description of the project, its purpose, and technologies used.

Feel free to explore each project folder for detailed documentation, source code, and instructions on how to run or use the projects.
