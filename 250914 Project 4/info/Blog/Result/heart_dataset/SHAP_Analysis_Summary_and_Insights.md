## üè• Clinical Recommendations Based on SHAP Analysis

### Risk Stratification Protocol

#### **High-Risk Patients (Aggressive Intervention)**
Combination of ‚â•2 high-impact features:

- **thal ‚â• 6** (fixed/reversible defect) AND **oldpeak ‚â• 1** (markers ECG ischemia) OR  
- **age ‚â• 65** AND (**cp ‚â• 3** OR **ca ‚â§ 2**)

#### **Intermediate-Risk Patients (Close Monitoring)**
Single high-impact feature OR multiple moderate features:
- **cp = 1-2** (atypical) OR **ca = 1** (single vessel) OR
- **thal = 7** (reversible) AND **oldpeak ‚â§ 1**

#### **Low-Risk Patients (Conservative Approach)**

1. **Chief Complaint**: Chest pain characterization (cp)
2. **Demographics**: Age, sex  
3. **Vital Signs**: Blood pressure, heart rate
